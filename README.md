# [Forever Engine](https://github.com/Yoshubs/FunkinForever)
An open-source [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) mod engine
----------------------------------------------
Forever Engine is an open source modification of the Friday Night Funkin' engine. Forever Engine is not to be confused with its original name, FUNKIN FOREVER, which is now no longer the name of the engine. The reason this is important will have to do with future plans of ours, so stay tuned if you'd like to hear more about those ;)
----------------------------------------------
The Forever Engine is based off of the aforementioned [Friday Night Funkin' Source](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin). It's made to be more accessible and easier to build off of, as well as having a lot of quality of life changes and a much more focused direction on the more traditional feel of rhythm games, all while still keeping the same style and feel of Friday Night Funkin'. I know a lot of source codes are hard to work with for friday night funkin', usually very unoptimised or very unorganised, I wanted to fix both of these issues with Forever Engine and Funkin' Forever in the future. True to the spirit of [Newgrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com), Friday Night Funkin' should be accessible by everyone, both modders and gamers alike, and I wanted to make it my goal to fix a lot of the issues that prevented people from being able to use the base game's engine, as well as create a more polished engines, as I was unhappy with the current existing ones at the time.

Forever Engine is getting a massive overhaul soon, hopefully you all enjoy it! It's meant to both optimise the engine more and allow for more customisations, I want this engine to be really customisable both by the player and by the mod makers using it, and I also wanted it to be lightweight and clean, this being some of the major reasons why I want to rewrite the engine entirely and why I separated Forever Engine and Funkin' Forever.
----------------------------------------------
Changelog 0.2
* entirely recreated the menus from the base game
* working options menu
* working custom controls
* pretty soon the game will be on par with the base game itself, which is pretty cool to think about

----------------------------------------------

Future Features: 
 All the future feature stuffs have been redirected to funkin' forever once that comes out, personally I want forever engine to be as lightweight and easy to use, so it most likely wont feature modcharts, if you want the TRUE DEFINITIVE RHYTHM GAME EXPERIENCE, all inside of your newgrounds love letter, I really hope you enjoy funkin' forever itself once its in a playable state!

CREDITS:
----------------------------------------------

[Yoshubs](https://github.com/Yoshubs) - made the engine (she's not a good programmer

[Pixloen](https://github.com/PixlJacket) - made a lot of the custom assets that forever engine uses, he also gave me a lot of general advice on how to improve the engine as well as his input on both how to improve upon the base game and how the input system felt and such. He basically co-owns the engine lmao

rest of the rise n' skate team - that mod is the reason im even making an engine right now so like I kind of owe you guys this whole engine and more for that honestly and I will actually do more so stay tuned

[ImCodist](https://github.com/ImCodist) - helped with a couple of pull requests and issue fixes, but, I'm not gonna give him any credit at all, because he stole my obsidian soul in minecraft and I will never forgive him for that!!!!

[HelloSammu](https://github.com/hellosammu) - weird catgirl programmer, they scare me

[ninjamuffin99](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/) - HE MADE THE BASE GAME SO LIKE WITHOUT HIM THIS WOULD NOT BE POSSIBLE GO CHECK HIM OUT RIGHT NOW

rest of fnf team (they are very good and very real ESPECIALLY PHANTOMARCADE HES GAMING

----------------------------------------------
How to Compile:

Basically, all of the files you need are in the engine itself through the setup.bat (Huge thanks to [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798) for the download to the file) except for Visual Studio Code, or whatever program you choose to use to program in the engine. If you've already worked with fnf, this should work perfectly with you and if it doesn't then you might have the wrong target settings, or Lime is probably broken, that's usually what happens with these things, it's happened to me a ton of times lmao. I'm not a very good programmer.
If you want some external sources that will better walk you through how to compile the game, look no further than the [base game github](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin) and [FNF Source Code Guide](https://gamebanana.com/tuts/13798), I really hope they help you out!
